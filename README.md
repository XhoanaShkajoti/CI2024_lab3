# **N-Puzzle Solver Using A\***

This lab implements an **N-Puzzle Solver** using the **A\*** search algorithm, combined with customized heuristics to ensure efficient and scalable performance across various puzzle dimensions. The solver can handle puzzles of size 3x3 to larger dimensions like 7x7 or more.

---

## **Features**

- **Customizable Puzzle Dimensions**:  
  Dynamically adjust the puzzle size N x N for different test cases.

- **Randomized Puzzle Generation**:  
  The start state is generated by applying a series of random moves to the goal state, ensuring solvability.

- **Advanced Heuristics**:  
  A combination of heuristics guides the solver:
  - **Weighted Manhattan Distance**: Measures the distance of tiles from their goal positions with additional weight.
  - **Combined Linear Conflict**: Penalizes tiles in the correct row/column but out of order.
  - **Adjusted Walking Distance**: Adds squared penalties for tiles farther from their goals.
  - **Misplaced Tiles**: Counts tiles not in their correct positions.
  - **Multiplication Factor**: Dynamically scales heuristic values based on puzzle size.

- **Optimized A\***:  
  The algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) for efficiency and memory-friendly state representation.

- **Replay Solution**:  
  The solution steps are printed, showing the transition from the start state to the goal state.

## **How It Works**

1. **Randomize Puzzle**:  
   The start state is created by applying a series of random moves to the goal state.

2. **A\* Search Algorithm**:  
   The solver prioritizes states using the function:
   \[
   f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
   \]
   - \(g(n)\): Cost to reach the current state.
   - \(h(n)\): Heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal.

3. **Heuristics**:  
   Heuristics estimate the cost to solve the puzzle and help the algorithm focus on promising states.
